# music xml time dilation
 A program designed to dilate the duration of passages of music in musicxml format.

The script needs a path to musescore or some other software supported by music21 for some I/O operations with musicxml files.

Edit the script to set the path to the file you want to dilate as well as the converstion factor.

Use on one part at a time.
